# Component Guide

## UI Components

The project uses ShadCN UI components which are located in the `src/components/ui` directory. These are pre-styled components built on top of Radix UI primitives and styled with TailwindCSS.

## Custom Components

- [src/components/ExactLogo.tsx](mdc:src/components/ExactLogo.tsx) - Logo component

## Usage Pattern

Components should be imported using the `@/` path alias:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
```

## Best Practices

1. Prefer composition over inheritance
2. Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
3. Use TypeScript props interfaces for component props
4. Leverage ShadCN UI components when possible instead of creating custom ones
